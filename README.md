# HeartGuard AI
**Platform Description**:
HeartGuard AI is a web-based application that utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. It aims to provide an efficient and convenient way for users to assess their risk of heart disease by analyzing their medical data.

**Functionality:**
1. User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and log in securely to access the system.
2. Data Input: Users are prompted to input the following details:
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Blood Pressure (Systolic and Diastolic)
   - Cholesterol Level
   - Fasting Blood Sugar
   - Electrocardiographic Results
   - Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
   - Exercise-Induced Angina
   - ST Depression Induced by Exercise
   - Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
   - Thallium Stress Test Result
3. Data Validation: The system ensures that the user's input is within valid ranges and formats. It may also include data cleansing and normalization to improve prediction accuracy.
4. AI Prediction: Utilizing a trained machine learning model, the system analyzes the input data to predict the likelihood of heart disease. The model considers various risk factors and medical parameters to make an accurate assessment.
5. Result Presentation: Users receive a clear and interpretable result indicating their risk level for heart disease. It may categorize the risk as low, moderate, or high.
6. Health Recommendations: Based on the risk level, users may receive general recommendations for maintaining heart health, such as lifestyle changes, diet suggestions, and exercise tips.

**User Experience:**
- Users visit the HeartGuard AI website.
- They register or log in to their accounts.
- Users are prompted to enter their medical data, which can be obtained from medical reports or tests.
- The system guides users through the data entry process, providing explanations for each parameter.
- After submitting the data, users receive an instant prediction of their heart disease risk.
- Users can view their historical predictions and track changes over time.
- The system provides easy-to-understand recommendations to improve heart health.
- Users can log out or update their data at any time.
  
**Project Aim:**
The aim of the HeartGuard AI project is to:
- Provide a user-friendly platform for individuals to assess their risk of heart disease.
- Utilize advanced machine learning techniques to deliver accurate predictions.
- Empower users to take proactive steps towards improving their heart health.
- Promote heart disease awareness and prevention in the community.
- Enhance early detection of heart disease, potentially saving lives through early intervention.
